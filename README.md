Best Practices
Keep it updated: Your README should evolve with your project

Be concise: Long READMEs are less likely to be read completely

Use consistent formatting: Maintain the same style throughout

Include examples: Show, don't just tell

Make it scannable: Use headings, lists, and white space effectively

Test your Markdown: Preview before committing

Localize if needed: Consider multiple READMEs for different languages

README Templates
For quick starts, consider these templates:
